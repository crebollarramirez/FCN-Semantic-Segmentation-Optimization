# Optimized-FCN-Segmentation
 This project explores advanced semantic segmentation techniques using CNN-based models like Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN), ResNet-based architectures, and U-Net. It incorporates data augmentation, class weighting, and learning rate scheduling to enhance segmentation on the PASCAL VOC-2012 dataset.
